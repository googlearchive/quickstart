## QuickStart

Welcome to the example application used in AngularDart's
[QuickStart](https://webdev.dartlang.org/angular/quickstart) page.

You can run a [hosted copy](http://angular-examples.github.io/quickstart) of this sample. Or run your own copy:

1. Clone or [download][] this repo.

2. Get the dependencies:

   `pub get`
  
3. Launch a development server:

   `pub serve`
  
4. Open a browser to `http://localhost:8080`.<br/>
  In Dartium, you'll see the app right away. In other modern browsers,
  you'll have to wait a bit while pub converts the app.
